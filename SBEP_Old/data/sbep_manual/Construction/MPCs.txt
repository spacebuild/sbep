/**MPCs - Mobile Platform Controllers**/

/*Mobile Platform Controllers, or MPCs, are a way of creating mechanisms which would otherwise require 
lots of complicated, laggy, unreliable wired hydraulics, sliders, or similar. They can also be used to 
create movements that would be near impossible to achieve with wire.*/

/*To spawn an MPC, open the Q-menu, and under the SBEP category, click on the MPC tool. Choose a model 
from the panel, or right-click a prop to copy its model. Left-click somewhere to spawn your MPC.*/

/*If you've positioned a prop in just the right place already, you can spawn an MPC in its place by 
holding shift whilst right-clicking.*/

/*MPCs need wire to be of any use. If you look at one with the wire tool, you will find a multitude of 
inputs. The important ones are X,Y,Z and Pitch,Yaw,Roll. These are the target offset values that the MPC 
will try to achieve, relative to its controller. Using buttons or toggle gates, with smoothers, for example, 
you can make the MPC move smoothly between two positions (and rotations). By using more complicated wire 
setups or expressions, you can create extremely complex movements, at very little performance cost.*/

/*One of the other very useful input sets is FulX,FulY,FulZ. This is the position of the "fulcrum" used 
by the MPC during movement and rotation. You can change this easily by pressing Reload with the MPC tool 
whilst looking at the place on the MPC you want this position to be. This is also an easy way to see how 
it affects the behaviour of the MPC. This feature essentially allows you to move the "centre" of the prop; 
for example, it enables the MPC to hinge along one edge rather than simply turning around its normal centre 
position, should you want to make a door or ramp of some kind.*/
