/**PART ASSEMBLER**/

/*The Part Assembler is a very simple way of putting parts together.*/

/*To snap two parts together, point the tool at a part, and the connection 
points will appear. Click one, then a second, to move the first prop 
to the second.*/

/*At the moment, only the SmallBridge parts work with the tool.*/
