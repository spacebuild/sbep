/**Docking Clamps**/

/*Docking clamps let you join ships or stations on-the-fly easily, quickly, and laglessly.*/

/*To spawn a docking clamp, open the Q-menu, and under the SBEP category, click on the 
Docking Clamp tool. Choose a model, and left click to spawn it. Right-clicking an existing 
clamp will spawn the counterpart which can dock with it.*/

/*To activate a clamp, use it with E or use the wire inputs. Two active clamps of matching types, 
when near each other, will move towards each other and lock together.*/

/*Some clamp models have doors which open and close in sync with the docking sequences.*/
